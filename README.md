This project demonstrates an AI-enhanced image generation application using Gradio, Hugging Face, and LangChain. It allows users to input a simple prompt, which is then expanded into a detailed description using a language model, and finally used to generate an image.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Built with Gradio for an interactive and intuitive user experience.
- **AI-Powered Prompt Enhancement**: Utilizes LangChain and Groq to transform basic prompts into detailed descriptions.
- **Image Generation**: Leverages Hugging Face's Inference API for high-quality image creation.
- **Example Prompts**: Pre-loaded prompts are available for quick testing and inspiration.
- **Customizable Image Dimensions**: Users can adjust the image size to meet their specific needs.
- **Dark Mode UI**: A visually appealing dark mode interface for comfortable usage.
